‚Ä¢ Analytical Thinking ‚Ä¢ Problem Solving ‚Ä¢ Proactivity ‚Ä¢ Teamwork

## üìã Key Activities:

Strategic role in designing and implementing cloud solutions focused on performance, security, automation, and cost optimization, following the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

‚Ä¢ Solution Architecture: Designed scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient solutions, reducing infrastructure expenses by up to 35% through auto scaling and smart AWS service selection.

‚Ä¢ Cloud Security: Built environments 100% compliant with IAM Least Privilege, MFA, KMS, WAF, and GuardDuty, decreasing incidents by up to 30%.

‚Ä¢ IaC & Automation: Multi-region provisioning using Terraform and CloudFormation, cutting configuration errors by 90% and tripling delivery speed.

‚Ä¢ AWS Migration: Delivered hybrid strategies using VPN, Direct Connect, and VPC Peering, achieving 35% cost savings with zero downtime.

‚Ä¢ Serverless Solutions: Architected applications with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, enabling auto scalability and cutting maintenance costs by 50%.

‚Ä¢ Containers & Microservices: Infrastructure with ECS and Fargate, handling 2M+ monthly requests with high availability.

‚Ä¢ Observability & Performance: Dashboards with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and AWS Config, reducing production incidents by up to 45%.

‚Ä¢ CI/CD: Pipelines with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Terraform Cloud, and GitHub Actions; implemented blue/green deployments, boosting delivery efficiency by 70%.

‚Ä¢ High Availability: Multi-AZ and Auto Scaling designs with Aurora Serverless, ensuring 99.99% uptime.
‚Ä¢ Cost Optimization: Leveraged Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor, generating annual savings of up to 25%.

‚Ä¢ Disaster Recovery: Architected solutions with RTO <5 min and RPO <1 min for critical systems.

‚Ä¢ Big Data: Projects with Redshift, S3, and Glue processing 10TB+ and accelerating business insights by 5x.

‚Ä¢ Networking & Connectivity: Optimized VPCs with Direct Connect and Transit Gateway, delivering low latency and throughput.
